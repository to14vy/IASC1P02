      <p>My name is Tokunbo Oyebolu and I am a second-year Computer Science
        Stundent at <a href="http://www.brocku.ca">Brock University</a> in Saint Catharines, ON. In 2004, my family
        set up our first home computer system. As you can imagine, it was big,
        bulky, not very attractive at first sight and definitely off limits to
        the kids (one of which, of course, I was at the time) but it was also
        a vision of what my future held for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>At age ten, computers began to fascinate me. It was no longer just a
        large electronic device, it was a portal to undiscovered territory, an
        outlet for imagination and a new path to fun. It became a treat to get
        to go back home and explore the capabilities of the contraption. Like
        many children my age at that time, we only got about two hours a week on
        average to spend with a computer at school so self-teaching was paramount
        if you ever wanted to master the device and thus began the studying.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I would be on that computer for hours, going through all the applications
        that interested me as well as those that didn't. I would practice any
        small lessons we learned at school and expand upon them just because I
        wanted to see how far I could go and how much I could impress my teachers.</p>
      <p>The great thing about my experiences were that they were encouraged. My
        father is a computer scientist so he was always into the next big thing in
        technology and he loved my creativity.</p>

      <p>Soon, I started incorporating elements of different subjects that I
        would cover in school with what I learned to do with computers. My
        earliest memory of this was writing stories and using Microsoft Word
        clip art to add illustrations to my stories. I couldn't wait to impress
        a publisher someday with my work, unfortunately my stories always happened
        to be just a bit longer than my attention span so only a few
        completed works made it into the harddrive. In my defense, Microsoft
        clipart never seemed to have all of the exact images I needed but then
        I discovered Google but that's a whole other story.</p>

    <div>
      <p>By highschool, I was taking my knowledge and testing it on a completley
        different level. I had registered for my first computer science class.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I thought that I was really making history. I was creating <!--need a link
        to Liesel presentation--> animated book presentions, getting extra credit
        for using internet resources to assist my in my math projects but I had
        never imagined that there was a whole other world to computers that (if I
        had take the time to learn how to manuever it before) could have helped
        me exponentially increase the amount of uncommon things I creatively
        taught myself to do with comouters. Now I had the chance to learn and
        was ready to soak it all in.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Fast forward a few great grades later and here I am, continuing my
        journey of creative discovery at Brock U with an amazing group of students
        preparing for their times to shine as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I don't know where my pursuit of a degree in Computer Science will take
        me but I hope that I can take Computer Science new places before I get there.</p>
