            <p><strong><br />Ariel Bio:</strong></p>
            <p>Ariel was one of 7 sisters. She lived under the sea in the city
              of Atlantica from a young age. Her father, King Triton ruled the
              underwater kingdom.
              All of her 6 royal sisters were content with their lives, but
              Ariel wanted more. Her fascination with the human world led her
              on dangerous and exciting treasure hunts. Her best friend,
              Flounder, often accompanied her. This also led to her befriending
              a noisy seagull named Scuttle.
              Ariel dreamed of becoming a human after meeting Prince Eric, and
              instantly fell in love with him. Her father disapproved, and
              destroyed the treasures she found in shipwrecks. Soon after, she
              bargained with the sea-witch Ursula, who promised to make her
              human for 3 days if Ariel gave Ursula her voice. If Ariel failed
              to make the Prince Eric fall in love with her and kiss her before
              the three days were up, she would have to return to the sea and
              belong to Ursula. If she did manage however, she could stay on land forever.
              During this very eventful time, Ariel almost succeeded in kissing
              Eric, something Ursula didn't want. Ursula transforms into a human
              named Vanessa, and puts a spell on Eric that makes him fall in love
              with a disguised Ursula. They are to be married on Eric's ship.
              With the help of her friends, Ariel makes it to the ship, where
              Scuttle breaks Vanessa's necklace. This breaks the spell and turns
              Ursula back into a sea-witch. Unfortunately, Ariel's voice returns
              too late, and she turns into her mermaid form.
              King Triton trades his life for that of his daughter's, Ursula
              gaining control of the seven seas. With her newfound powers, Ursula
              grows into her giant self and tries to kill Ariel, but Eric dives
              the main mast of a sunken ship in Ursula's body, killing her.
              In the end, King Triton sees how happy his daughter is and he uses
              his magical trident to turn Ariel into a human, and she and Eric get married.
