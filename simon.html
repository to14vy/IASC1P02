            <p> Simon has two brothers of his own that are definitely on opposite spectrums of the scale.
              On one hand, he's got sweet, innocent Theodore and on the other hand, he
              must deal with wild and rambunctious Alvin. Just tell him your bro stories
              and he should be able to relate very well!</p>

            <p><strong><br />Simon Bio:</strong></p>
            <p>Simon Seville is the oldest of three chipmunks. He possesses a
              very dry sense of humor and a keen of wit. His younger brother,
              Alvin, often uses Simon's master mind for his crazy schemes
              because he is smart enough to carry them out. In the end, Simon
              loves Alvin, but secretly worries that the share they same gene pool.
              His signature color is blue and he has gray-blue eyes and glasses.
              He plays the bass, bass clarinet, saxophone, bagpipes, tuba, drums,
              and the keyboard. He always looks out protectively toward his brothers,
              especially Theodore, who always seems to get sucked into Alvin's schemes.
