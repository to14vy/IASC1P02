        <h3 style="clear:both"> Welcome to Heart Helper Counselling Services </h3>
        <p> Has your best friend refused to take your calls? Does your boyfriend seem
          to always be "working" whenever you want to hang out? Has your little sister
          grown out of wanting to chill with you? If so, you are in the right place!<br />
          Heart Helper Counselling Services is a service designed to help people like
          you get through challenging times in all types of relationships. Because,
          let's face it: not everyone like us <em> all </em> of the time. Sometimes,
          people just act strange towards us and we have no clue why! However, thanks
          to this wonderful service, you can connect with every-day individuals (who
          also double as qualified counsellors) who have gone through it before.<br />
          It's always nice to take to someone who gets it when your going THROUGH it and
          now, with just a click of a button, you can! <br /><br />
          <strong>Well, what are you waiting for? Fill out our Match Up Form and
            get paired up with one of our counsellors today!</strong>
