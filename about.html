        <h3 style="clear:both"> What is Heart Helpers Counselling Services? </h3>

        <p> We all know that there are times when the people that we hold
          dearest and nearest to our hearts start acting KA-RAY-ZAY!
          Not picking up your calls, not answering your texts, not liking your
          new pictures on social media, avoiding meeting up with you, and so on.
          Or maybe you are the one being distant for one reason or another...<br /><br />
          Now, you may be thinking, "What's up with <em>THEM?</em>"
          We all know that at those times, it's very important to take time
          out to try to work it out, but what if the outcome is
          less than favourable? Maybe all of this unusual behaviour was just a
          prelude to the revelation of a bigger problem in your relationship!<br />
          <strong>This is where we come in.</strong><br /><br />
          If you need advice, a shoulder to cry on, someone to help you take your
          mind off of it or just listening ears, here we are to help. Heart Helpers
          has employed several registered counsellors that are more than qualified
          to help you navigate any rocky relationship. However, our main goal is for this
          to be a temporary service for you while you repair or move on
          from your situation with your head held high!<br /><br /><br />
          <strong>Think of us as your "back-up best-friend" and we'll do our very best
          to make sure that your heart heals and you move on, happier and
          healthier than ever before!</strong><br /><br /><br />
