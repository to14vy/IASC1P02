            <p><strong><br />Kermit Bio:</strong></p>
            <p>Kermit the Frog is a Muppet, one of puppeteer Jim Henson's most
              famous and beloved creations, first introduced in 1955.
              On Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Kermit commented to Ty Pennington,
              "You know, as a tadpole in the swamp, I had 3,265 brothers and sisters!"
              According to Kermit's Swamp Years, at the age of 12, he was the first
              of his siblings to leave the swamp, and one of the first frogs to talk
              to humans. In that he is portrayed as encountering a 12-year-old
              Jim Henson (played by Christian Kebbel) for the first time.
              According to The Muppet Movie, Kermit returned to the swamp, where
              a passing agent noted he had talent and, thus inspired, he headed
              to Hollywood, encountering the rest of The Muppets along the way.
              Together, they were given a standard "rich and famous" contract by
              Lew Lord of Wide World Studios and began their showbiz careers.
              Kermit is the main protagonist of many Muppet projects, most notably
              as the host of The Muppet Show, and has appeared in various sketches
              on Sesame Street, in commercials and in public service announcements over the years.
              Kermit was performed by Jim Henson until his death in 1990. Since then,
              Kermit has been performed by Steve Whitmire. He was voiced by Frank
              Welker in Muppet Babies and occasionally in animation. Kermit is left handed.
              Kermit has admitted in fairly recent interviews that he and Miss
              Piggy are a couple in a US Magazine Interview dated 23 November
              2011 entitled: Miss Piggy and Kermit: How We've Stayed Together.
