			The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
			It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse
			has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus,
			into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around
			4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses
			in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live
			in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term
			is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered
			Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There
			is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering
			everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and
			behavior.

			Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive
			recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture,
			entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide
			variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of
			equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including
			meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant
			mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention
			from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.
